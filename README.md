# Tim Berners Lee

## Description of the project
In this project we have to replicate a webpage precisely. The web page is about Tim Berners Lee the inventor of HTML 

## Link to the webpage
[My copy](https://a3lequenne.github.io/Tim_berners_lee/)

## Technologies used
HTML5 and CSS3 (no frameworks :sadge:)

## Possible Improvements
- Im not quite sure about my usage of the semantics tags yet (cant find real good alternative for span sometimes)
- The "second navbar" doenst move yet
- Desktop version not finished yet
- The icons are only icons (No hamburger menu)
- Font size is implemented badly (but it works well so not a priority to change the code only for the sake of it)
- I just realized (October 12th 1.40PM) that the big blue buttons are not buttons/links. I'll change it tomorrow if we get more time.
