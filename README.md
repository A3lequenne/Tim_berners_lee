# Tim Berners Lee

## Description of the project
In this project we have to replicate a webpage precisely. The web page is about Tim Berners Lee the inventor of HTML 

## Link to the webpage
[My copy](https://a3lequenne.github.io/Tim_berners_lee/)

## Technologies used
- HTML5 and CSS3 (no frameworks :sadge:)
- Development made on iPhone XR and 24" Desktop screen (I know it's far from perfect on other screens)

## Possible Improvements
- Im not quite sure about my usage of the semantics tags yet (cant find real good alternative for span sometimes)
- The "second navbar" doenst move yet
- The icons are only icons (No hamburger menu)
- Font size is implemented badly (but it works well so not a priority to change the code only for the sake of it)
- No border around the big block of elements in the Desktop view (I didnt think about it until now 12th of October 3.42AM and its too late to change everything)
## What i realized during this exercice
- I dont use enough relative values for responsive positioning. I'll work on that.
